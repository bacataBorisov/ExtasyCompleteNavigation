Here I will describe all the mssages that I see from the sample string in the nanoPi named "p1".
I don't know how many of them are real but I will check once everything is readble and we go
to the boat and check in place.

Talker Identifiers

-> II - Integrated Instrumentation
-> GP - GPS (Global Positioning System)


*** All the following tags are from II - boat navigation ***

DPT - DPT Heading – Deviation & Variation
//need to check if there is the devieation value
$--DPT,%f,,*hh - debtp as a float in meters

1) Depth, meters
2) Offset from transducer;
positive means distance from transducer to water line,
negative means distance from transducer to keel

HDG - Heading – Deviation & Variation
$--HDG,%i,,,%f,a*hh - heading as Int, magnetic variation in degrees as float, we don't have the rest in the string that is why the numbers are like that

1) Magnetic Sensor heading in degrees
4) Magnetic Variation degrees
5) Magnetic Variation direction, E = Easterly, W = Westerly
6) Checksum

MTW - Water Temperature

2) Reference, R = Relative, T = True
3) Wind Speed
4) Wind Speed Units, K/M/N
5) Status, A = Data Valid
6) Checksum

*** Tags from GPS -> talker identifier GP *** () - probably not all the values are very useful,
I need to decide which ones I will use
