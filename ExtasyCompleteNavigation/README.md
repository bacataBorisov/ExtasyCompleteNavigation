#Extasy Sailing Navigation
##Project Description:

1. General Information

* The project is intended to be used in collaboration with B&G h1000 sailing navigation instrumentation to display navigational data. B&G to NMEA protocol device (sold by B&G) is used to convert the data and send it via serial communication to a nanoPi. The latter sends the data over the wi-fi network and is being read and converted to a user friendly view on a iPad / iPhone which can be installed on a sailing boat and used for navigation / sailing / racing purposes. 
* Besides the standard data (wind speed, wind direction, depth, speed, etc) there is an additional feature implemented - a polar diagram for the certain boat can be uploaded and the navigation uses the data to give you the best performance values according to the diagram, thus optimisation during racing is significantly increased. 
* Few devices (iPads, iPhones) can be connected at the same time, and be placed around the boat for easier access to the navigation data.

2. Install & Run

* The project is about to be tested in real situations and can't be downloaded from the AppStore. 

3. Credits - packages and sources of information that I have used in my project

* CocoaAsyncSocket

4. What's next?

* After the initial tests have been performed and confirmed that the navigational data is relevant the app could be upgraded with different features.
