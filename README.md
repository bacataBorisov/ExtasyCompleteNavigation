# Extasy Complete Navigation

[üì± Check out the iPhone demo video](https://youtube.com/shorts/T2OzuNGgfEw)

## Project description

This app was designed for a particular sailing boat but can be further developed to fit the needs of any other boat or vessel that works with the NMEA standard. It uses a Raspberry Pi connected to the B&G serial bus, receiving NMEA signals from various sensors (speed, wind, magnetic compass, depth, GPS). NMEA strings are sent over Wi-Fi via socket communication on port 4950, and the data is displayed in a user-friendly way on iOS devices (iPhone, iPad). 

### Note: The app requires an iOS device with iOS 17 or later.

Key Features:

## **Key Features of Extasy Complete Navigation**

- **üì° Real-time Data Display**  
  - Receives live sensor data via Wi-Fi from the boat's NMEA system.  
  - Displays key navigation metrics such as speed, heading, depth, and wind.

- **‚õµ Polar Diagram Integration**  
  - Optimizes sailing performance using the boat's predefined polar speeds.  
  - Helps achieve the best sailing efficiency based on wind and speed conditions.

- **üìä Multi Display View**  
  - Fully customizable display to track important sailing metrics.  
  - Persistent session settings allow users to save their preferred layout.  
  - Tap-to-swap feature enables quick reconfiguration of displayed values.

- **üó∫Ô∏è Waypoint Management**  
  - Add, edit, and navigate to waypoints with an intuitive interface.  
  - Display waypoint position on the map with directional indicators.

- **üö® Alarms & Alerts**  
  - Depth alarm triggers when water depth falls below a critical threshold.  
  - Future updates will allow customization of alarms for other parameters.

- **‚öôÔ∏è Customizable Settings**  
  - Configure units (e.g., knots, meters, nautical miles) for different parameters.  
  - Option to view raw NMEA sensor data for troubleshooting and insights.  
  - Planned improvements include adjustable alarm thresholds and user preferences.

- **üîÄ Multiple Display Modes**  
  - Switch between different views, including multi-display and ultimate display.  
  - A hidden display view reveals additional navigation information.

- **üìç Boat and Waypoint Tracking**  
  - Displays real-time boat position and heading relative to waypoints.  
  - Provides an estimated time of arrival (ETA) and velocity made good (VMG).  
  - Shows waypoint bearing (BTM) with an intuitive indicator.

- **üíæ Persistent Data Storage**  
  - Saves user preferences and configurations across sessions.  
  - Ensures consistent UI layout even after restarting the app.

- **üåä NMEA 0183 Protocol Compatibility**  
  - Works seamlessly with industry-standard NMEA 0183 data streams.  
  - Compatible with a variety of sensors, including GPS, wind, and depth instruments.

The app is developed in accordance with the [NMEA 0183 protocol v. 3.01.](https://www.plaisance-pratique.com/IMG/pdf/NMEA0183-2.pdf)

### Note: *This is the initial release and is still undergoing real-world tests and improvements. There is potential for additional features and optimization.*

## Installation

The app is still in development and not available on the App Store. You need an Apple developer account to install and test the app:
1. Clone the repository in Xcode.
2. Build and run the app on a simulator or a real device.

You will be able to use it for 7 days with free account and 1 year, or no-longer than you subscription expiration date, if you have paid developer subscription.

## Usage

Ensure you are on the same network as the device sending data on port 4950. The app will connect automatically and display sensor data on the relevant segments of the displays.
